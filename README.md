Dune Station 14 is a fork of Space Station 14 which is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).

To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
